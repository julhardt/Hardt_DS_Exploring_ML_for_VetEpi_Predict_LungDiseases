**Project Title**: Exploring Machine Learning Methods for Veterinary Epidemiology: Prediction of Lung Diseases in Pigs


**Description**: 
This project has been implemented for an certification as "Data Scientist".  
It uses a simulated data set from Veterinary Epidemiology and several Data Science methods for a prediction of the prevalence of lung diseases.  
The project has been implemented in Python as a .py program script, using Visual Studio Code as development environment.  

## Requirements
An enviroment with Python 3.9.13 is required.  
No tests have been done with different Python versions.
## Installation
It is recommended to use a virtual environment for setup.  
To run this project, you need to install the packages defined in requirements.txt:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```   
On Linux machines, the script ```setup.sh``` provides a convinient way to install the dependancies in a virtual environment.

## Folder Structure
Repository contains the Python script ```PADS_JH_program_complete_final.py``` to load the data and do all analyses.
+ ```data``` contains the simulated data needed for the analyses.
+ ```figures``` contains the figures produced with the program.
+ ```supplement``` contains additional material of the project thesis:
    + ```figures```:
      contains additional figures as descriptive analyses of the simulated data

## Execution
Use the PADS_JH_program_complete_final.py to reproduce the analyses from the data.
Where parts of the code - esp. for figures - are wrapped with #%% to be run separately, use the "Run cell" code to produce analyses and figures reliably.
